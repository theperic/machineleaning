This left 53 columns in my data set.  \n\n```{r, cache=TRUE}\n    \n\n    train_data<-read.csv(\"pml-training.csv\")\n    test_data<-read.csv(\"pml-testing.csv\")\n\n## drop columns with NAs in the training data\n    test_data<-test_data[ , ! apply( train_data , 2 , function(x) any(is.na(x)) ) ]\n    train_data<-train_data[ , ! apply( train_data , 2 , function(x) any(is.na(x)) ) ]\n    \n    train_data<-train_data[ , ! apply( test_data , 2 , function(x) any(is.na(x)) ) ]\n    test_data<-test_data[ , ! apply( test_data , 2 , function(x) any(is.na(x)) ) ]\n    \n\n```\n\nAfter preliminary data analysis I excluded the x variable, the subject names, the times stamps, and the window descritions as the tests seemed to be ordered by the class, thus these variable provides a correlation we cannot expect in future data sets.\n```{r, cache=TRUE}\n    ## Remove the X column as this is an idex that happens to be highly correlated to the outcomes due to sorting.\n    train_data<-train_data[ ,c(-1, -2,-3,-4, -5,-6,-7) ]\n    test_data<-test_data[ ,c(-1, -2,-3,-4, -5,-6,-7) ]\n    \n\n```\n\n    \nI also noticed that several numberic data points were stored as factors, so I converted the data set to numerics\n\n```{r, cache=TRUE}\n    for(i in c(1:(ncol(train_data)-1))){\n        train_data[,i]<-as.numeric(train_data[,i])\n        test_data[,i]<-as.numeric(test_data[,i])\n    }\n    \n```\n\nI allocated 60% of the data to my training set and reserved 40% for cross validation.\n\n```{r, cache=TRUE}\n## Create training set split\n    inTrain<-createDataPartition(y=train_data$classe, p=.6, list=FALSE)\n    training<-train_data[inTrain,]\n    testing<-train_data[-inTrain,]\n\n\n```\n\nAfter testing linear and rPart models I selected the Random Forest model for my analysis. I have read that the number of trees required is optimized at when set to the square root of the vaiables. Here after removing incomplete variables I had 53 remaining, requiring approximately 8 trees.   \n\n```{r, cache=TRUE}\n    forest<-train(classe ~., data=training, method=\"rf\", ntree=8,prox=TRUE)\n\n\n    ```\n\n\n#Expected Error rate\n\nBased on the cross validation of running the prediction against the partitioned section of the training data file, I expect the out of sample error rate to be less than 2% based on the cross validation below demonstrating over 98% correct results in my out of sample test:\n\n```{r}\n    pred<-predict(forest,testing)\n    testing$predRight<-pred==testing$classe\n    correct<-sum(testing$predRight)/length(pred)\n    correct\n\n```\n\n\nAnd the confusion matrix is as follows:\n```{r}\n    table(pred,testing$classe)\n\n```\n\nThese results confirm that limiting to 8 trees was sufficient for a good predictive model.  I did test with more trees, up to 50, and found only marginal improvement in the results with greatly increased compute time.\n\nFor the test data file I ran my final model against the test data with the following result:\n\n```{r}\n    pred_from_test<-predict(forest,test_data)\n    answers<-as.character(pred_from_test)\n    answers\n```\n\nFinally, I output the results into separate files for upload.\n\n```{r}\n\n    ## I am using the instructors code for creating my output files.\n\n    pml_write_files = function(x){\n        n = length(x)\n        for(i in 1:n){\n            filename = paste0(\"problem_id_\",i,\".txt\")\n            write.table(x[i],file=filename,quote=FALSE,row.names=FALSE,col.names=FALSE)\n        }\n    }\n\n\npml_write_files(answers)\n\n```\n\n",
